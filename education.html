                            During my high school years, I actively sought opportunities to excel academically and 
                            immerse myself in the world of technology. I was honored with the Outstanding Student in Computer Science award
                            , recognizing my achievements in advanced programming courses. Additionally, I led a team in developing a mobile app
                             for a local community project, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
                              These experiences ignited my interest in IT and laid the foundation for my decision to embark on a degree in 
                              the field.</p>
